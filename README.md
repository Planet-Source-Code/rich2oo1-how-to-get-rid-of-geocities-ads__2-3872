### Source Code

<font face="verdana" size="2">Okay, i liked the response i got on how to remove angelfire banners, so i figured i'd figure out how to remove geocities. well, since geocities put's their ads at the very end of the page, all you have to do is put the following line right after your <b>&lt;/html&gt;</b> sign:<br><br>
<b><font size="+1">&lt;noembed&gt;&lt;xmp&gt;</font></b><br><br>
It's that simple. All feedback and votes are greatly appreciated.
